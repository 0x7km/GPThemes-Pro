## Permissions

-   **Storage**: GPThemes requests permission to access browser storage to save your chosen theme name, custom accent color and custom font properties. This ensures a consistent and personalized experience across ChatGPT website.
-   **ChatGPT Website Access**: GPThemes requires access to specific URLs to modify the visual appearance of the ChatGPT website. This includes `https://chat.openai.com/` and `https://chatgpt.com/` (new domain). This access is necessary for the extension to function properly and provide a customized interface.
-   **Notifications**: GPThemes uses this permission to notify you when a new update for the extension is available. Clicking on the notification will open the changelog in a new tab, allowing you to easily review the changes.
-   **Tabs**: This permission is used in conjunction with notifications. When you click on an update notification, GPThemes will open a new tab and automatically direct you to the changelog, providing you with information about the latest changes and improvements to the extension.

## Supported Versions

> [!WARNING]
> Please be aware that GPThemes is currently tailored to enhance the experience for `GPT-4o` and `GPT-3.5`. The `GPT Pro` is not fully supported yet! Probably the style is not as intended for certain elements! </br>
> Exploring and editing all the elements of `GPT Pro` version may be considered in future updates.

## Disclaimer

-   I'd like to remind you that **ChatGPT frequently updates its website**, and even minor changes can sometimes cause unexpected issues with the extension's functionality and appearance.
-   Your patience are greatly appreciated. If you notice any obvious issues with the appearance or functionality of the extension, I'm likely already working on it or it has already been fixed, but the new release is not pushed yet or the Chrome Store hasn't yet reflected the changes live. You can track the status on GitHub to stay informed.
-   Please note that this is a hobby project and it all depends on my available free time, so it might take a little while to get everything up and running. </br>

**Thank you for your understanding.**
